# Golice
this is the source code for Golice, a CS50 final project that displays the gold current and accurate price with many other features in the form of a web app
you might use the part that you like from the code but never touch the name Golice or the logo or the color them as it is not an open source and owned by the creeator himself
Golice Idia came originally from our need for simplicity when reading about finance, gold, currencies, or any other topic that are usually not visualized clearly enough for the average user
the Golice project is submetted to the CS50 course as my graduate project.
